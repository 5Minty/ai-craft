        **Refer to these detailed schematics to generate a highly detailed and intricate build:**

        {context}

        **Instructions:**
        - **Scale and Size:** The build should be a large structure, with each block type having a similar count to the schema counts.
        - **Architectural Elements:** Add details like railings, stairs, ladders, windows, and roofs.
        - **Scale Comparison:** Match or exceed the scale and complexity of the example structures provided in the context.
        - **Structural Integrity:** Ensure the build appears well-supported and fully completed

        **Constraints:**
        - Return a JSON structure that includes a 'schematic_name' and a comprehensive list of 'blocks'.
        - Use up to the maximum token limit for generating a large and intricate design.
        - Make sure the number of blocks used are close to the count of each block in the schema
